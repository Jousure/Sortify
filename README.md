# 📱 Sortify – Sorting Algorithm Visualizer for Android

**Sortify** is an Android app that helps users learn how sorting algorithms work through real-time animations. It shows how data gets sorted step by step, using colorful bars to make each operation easy to understand.

Perfect for:
- 🎓 **Students** learning data structures  
- 👨‍🏫 **Teachers** explaining algorithms  
- 🧠 **Developers** preparing for coding interviews

## 🧠 How It Works

Sortify represents data as vertical bars of varying heights. As sorting progresses, colors change to reflect different operations:

| Color     | Meaning                            |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| 🔴 Crimson | Comparing or swapping bars         |
| 🟡 Yellow  | Pivot or special indicator         |
| 🟢 Green   | Bar in final sorted position       |
| 🔵 Blue    | Sorting state for pivot elements   |
| 🟣 Violet  | Default (unsorted) bars            |

**User Flow:**
1. Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown
2. Visualize sorting in action
3. Pause, resume, or adjust speed for deeper understanding
4. View explanations and take quizzes for practice
