# Sortify - Sorting Algorithm Visualizer for Android

Sortify is an Android app that helps users learn how sorting algorithms work through real-time animations. It shows how data gets sorted step by step, using colorful bars to make each operation easy to understand.

This app is helpful for students, teachers, and developers who want a better way to understand sorting logic and data structures. It can also be useful for coding interview preparation.

## Features ##

- Animated visualizations for popular sorting algorithms
- Color indicators for comparisons, swaps, pivot elements, and sorted bars
- Controls to pause, resume, and change sorting speed
- Descriptions and time complexities for each algorithm
- Quiz section with different difficulty levels to test understanding
- Simple and responsive user interface

## Technologies Used ##

- Java - Handles the logic of sorting and thread control
- XML - Used to design the app layout and screens
- Android Studio - Development environment

## How It Works

Sortify visualizes sorting algorithms using animated vertical bars of varying heights, each representing a data element.

- During sorting, **colors indicate operations**:
  - **Crimson** – Bars currently being compared or swapped
  - **Yellow** – Pivot or special indicator
  - **Green** – Bars in their correct sorted position
  - **Blue** – Pivot's sorting state
  - **Violet** – Default (unsorted) bars

- Users can:
  - Choose an algorithm from a dropdown menu
  - Watch the algorithm sort the bars in real time
  - Pause, resume, or adjust the animation speed
  - View algorithm descriptions and time complexities

This interactive approach makes it easier to understand how each algorithm works step by step.

## Installation

To run Sortify on your device:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jousure/Sortify.git
2. **Open the project in Android Studio.**

3. **Build the project using Gradle or by selecting Build > Make Project from the menu.**

4. **Run the app on an Android emulator or a physical Android device.**
